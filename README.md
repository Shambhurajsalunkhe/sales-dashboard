Interactive Sales Dashboard (Python, Statistics)
I developed a web-based interactive sales dashboard using Python that allows users to upload sales data in CSV format.
The system automatically cleans the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies.
It performs exploratory data analysis and calculates key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, revenue trends, and category-wise performance.
The dashboard presents insights through interactive charts and filters, enabling users to analyze sales patterns over time and make data-driven decisions. 
It also supports exporting filtered data for reporting purposes.
